PLSQL anonymous block 

This block of code is called an Anonymous PL/SQL Block.

An anonymous PL/SQL block is a block of code that is executed immediately, without being stored in a database as a named procedure or function. It is called "anonymous" because it does not have a name.

This type of block is typically used for testing, debugging, or executing a one-time task. It can contain variable declarations, executable code, and exception handling, just like a named PL/SQL procedure or function.
===========================


DECLARE
  quantity NUMBER := 15;
  price NUMBER := 100.0;
  discount NUMBER;
BEGIN
  discount := calculate_discount(quantity, price);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Discount: ' || discount);
END;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE calculate_and_print_discount
AS
  quantity NUMBER := 15;
  price NUMBER := 100.0;
  discount NUMBER;
BEGIN
  discount := calculate_discount(quantity, price);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Discount: ' || discount);
END;
